				<h2>When?</h2>
				<p>Thursday, Friday. March 17 + 18, 2022</p>
				
				<h2>Who?</h2>
				<p>Everyone! All Team's everywhere within Airkit</p>
				
				<h2>Where?</h2>
				<p>Wherever you are!</p>
				
				<h2>What?</h2>
				<p>A two day major hacking event. Find teammates to work on a project and address an area where you think the company can grow. Points given for collaboration, audacity, heroic attempts, cross discipline work, and try hard.</p>
				
				<p>At the end of the two days your team will present to the company in 3 minutes or less what you accomplished and why you think the company should do this.</p>
				
				<h2>Why?</h2>
				<p>Airkit is committed to innovation. One way we show this by asking ourselves what would make things better. We take the time, once a quarter, to allow teammates to show ideas they feel passionate about.</p>
